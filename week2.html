   <h1> The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction</h1>
   <h2>Sept. 28th 2025</h2>
   <p>
I wanted to focus on two quotes I really enjoyed from the text this week and the thoughts that followed after I read them. The first one being: “The painter maintains in his work a natural distance from reality, the cameraman penetrates deeply into its web”. This is why we can see ourselves in show/movie characters like Bojack Horseman or Walter White. These characters are created with a depth that is based in real life and put on a screen. This allows for reflection, introspection, and critical thought. The ways in which we relate to TV personalities often is dependent upon where we are in our lives and the different things we might be going through at that moment in time. It relates to the point that was made on page 3, “even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.” We watch old Disney movies and listen to 90s playlists because of nostalgia. Nothing can take you back to the way you felt when you watched The Cheetah Girls premiere on TV or when you read R.H Sin’s work when it first came out. We are changed individuals after we consume different media and nothing can replicate the headspace you were in when you allowed yourself to be socialized by a piece of work that so many people are watching/looking at for the first time too (and maybe at the same time as you). TV and film are different from other types of media because you can rewatch them. They give you the comfort you craved when you were a viewer the first time. I always watch 17 Again when I’ve had a bad day because it cheers me up and even though I have seen the movie 101 times I always look forward to rewatching it because of how it makes me feel. The experience of then sharing these moments with others who have experienced this piece of media is one of a kind. We create special bonds with people who enjoy the same things as us and look forward to finding new pieces of media that our companionships would like. We listen to the thoughts of a youtube docu-series we saw or the podcast we stumbled upon this morning and then share the ideas of others as our own with our own interpretation of what we think was meant. I’m moving far from where I first began but I wanted to bring it to this quote I thought was interesting, “I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have been replaced by moving images.” I want to pose the question, have we ever been able to just think? We are influenced to think by everything we’re exposed to. Our thoughts aren’t free and they aren’t our own. We take inspiration from everything we see and all of the things we are inspired by have been inspired by other things before us. So with that being said, is there such a thing as an original thought? Is there a space in our minds where we can think wildly with no outside input that can infiltrate our ideas?

Another idea I found interesting as I read this text was the rise of socialism and how Art for art’s sake was born - a concept that stated that art shouldn’t be political, it should focus on things like color, line, and composition. I think that people fail to realize that everything is political and has some kind of political weight in modern society. We are socialized from the minute we are born, to our last moments alive. Even after our deaths the ways we are talked about in the presence of others socializes everyone that hears about us. The fact that people feel like they can remove themselves from the political narrative and just exist is a privilege that is granted to no one because even silence is political. You can choose to ignore political cartoons, make art that only uses the color purple, or completely walk away from conversations as soon as they take a political shift, but you are not free from political affiliation. The politics we are surrounded by are like a bond that sticks to us no matter where we go and it starts with the color of our skin. Seeing as this is so it is no wonder the person who came up with this concept was a white man. The kind of art that you are able to make is political because we make art that is based on our experiences and using what we have at our disposal. This reminds me of a quote I read online by Palestinian Poet Marwan Makhoul, “In order for me to write poetry that isn’t political, I must listen to the birds and in order to hear the birds the warplanes must be silent”
