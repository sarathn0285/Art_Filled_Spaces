   <h1>As We May Think</h1>
   <h2>Oct. 5th 2025</h2>
   <p>
Modern day technology has gotten eerie, greed has gotten sinister. Reading this text was interesting because you could see the genuine excitement for the age of technology and all of its advancements. It’s scary to think of just how far we’ve come, how dependent we are on our tech, and how much of it there actually is. A quote that stood out to me was, “Man has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. The applications of science have built him a well supplied house and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons.” Technology today is used for positive purposes like conducting research, communicating globally, and doing laundry but also used for negative purposes like surveillance, receiving misinformation, and cyberbullying. When the Blackberry came out it was all fun and games, the sidekick made texting fun and windows computers had their catchy little tune when they powered on/off. Today everything is monotonous and used against us. Apple has become one of the most powerful monopolies on the market with its ugly upgrades and disappearing accessories (I say as I write from my Apple branded laptop). Billionaires continue to suck up all the money they can and tell the rest of us we need to point fingers at each other, all while they watch us fight through the computer screens that were built off the backs of black and brown people. Tech has been on an upward incline that has lined the pockets of CEOs that have invested in its rise. But will tech be the demise of society? Will AI data centers completely leave residents living nearby without water? Will the $700 million funding in AI military warfare continue to ravish the Palestinians in Gaza and then move to other areas that the ultra rich deem in need of ethnic cleansing? Where do we go from here? Will we make AI friends? Partners? Pets? And let’s not even get into censoring and the immense amount of media propaganda we’ve been force fed. Tiktok is no longer an app of free speech as capitalism continues to destroy community and any sense of togetherness we could create. Everything is owned by 6 huge companies that sell our data back and forth. We’re all pawns in a tech scheme that has gone too far from our reach, and with meta glasses and AI powered scenes of Michael Jackson and Tupac “chilling” in Cuba, I fear it’s too late to turn back the clock on how tech is supposed to be used.

I remember when I first found out about the existence of sex robots, that paired with the movie Her and I was completely freaked out that people relied on human connection from robots. Now that future feels like it’s here. With the introduction of AI so readily available and ready to go at a moment's notice people have turned to chatbots to fill in the gaps of their lives. There has been a new introduction of ads on the  MTA’s pee stained subway walls containing the bullshit surveillance necklaces disguised as companionship, also known as friendship.com. Given the current political climate and the use of AI by ICE to capture and detain people off the streets of many major urban cities, everyday civilians have completely vandalized and obliterated these ads deeming them the end of humanity and urging people not to purchase these monitored orbs. But it's almost as if we have them in our homes already. Amazon Alexas, ring doorbells, cameras, smart tvs, laptops, phones, etc. all of these things are hackable and can be used as spyware to watch us in our own homes, and with so much of our information readily available online there’s not much people don’t already know about us anyways. I don’t want to take away from how technology has helped us advance as a society because there’s so many good examples: airplanes, cancer research, cars, vaccinations of all kinds, being able to check my email at 3 am amongst other things. But does the good outway the bad? It depends on who you ask, tech today has had an effect on everyone. From iPad kids to your dad who’s still saving his walkman just in case they make a comeback, tech has gone through many faces and the generations to come will have to deal with the new faces that have been forced on us. As tech progresses so too does greed and as more people find out the truths of how tech and evil go hand in hand, the more they resist the watchful eye of our modern day “Big Brother”.
