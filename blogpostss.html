    <h2><i>Introduction & Randomness from “10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10”, by Nick Montfort et al, 2013:</i></h2>
    <p>The introduction lays out how code and coding languages are cultural artifacts created with aesthetics and functionality. These choices can tell us a lot about the societies that create them. With computers we can assign meaning to almost anything. Someone decided that “RND” should mean random and not “RnD”, or even “$$$”. These choices can do things like limit accessibility. It’s much easier to understand random if the code refers to it as “RND” as opposed to “$$$”. </p> 
<p>The book also explains how randomness has always been essential to forms of play and creativity. Although code and computer systems may seem deterministic, they are filled with cultural meaning and aesthetic choices that rely on balancing levels of randomness. The most relatable experience I have was that of watching my dad play online poker on our family computer growing up. In games like these, elements like difficulty can be controlled with randomness algorithms. If a computer controlled opponent is too random, they can be too hard to predict and feel non-human, but give them just the right amount of randomness and you now have an adequately challenging opponent. In AI, features like “temperature” control how random or reproducible the AI’s answer will be. If you want your AI to be more “creative”, you can up the randomness of its answers! Even non-digital artists use randomness to generate creativity, like when a painter throws paint at a canvas instead of meticulously painting each stroke. Randomness is and has always been an important piece of human creativity.</p>

    <h2><i>"Lo and Behold” by Werner Herzong, 2016:</i></h2>
    <p>I found the film genuinely entertaining. Although the film was only produced 10 years ago, it felt somewhat archival, given the technological advancements we have seen post-pandemic. The movie title being <i>Lo and Behold</i> was serendipitous, in that this verbiage has been used in the King James Bible. It solicits a similar feeling for me as I experience when looking at <i>The Creation of Adam</i>. Although the film tries to emphasize the glory of the internet, the community that started it is not the community that currently runs it. I think we are in a critical time where accountability should be demanded from our institutional leaders. It is easy to “be doomy” over the state the internet is currently in, but this is where trial and error must take place. For example, the Catsouras family experienced, arguably, some of the worst trolling the internet has to offer. Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the visibility of the late Kobe Bryant’s accident that legal safeguards were provided. A portion of this film explored what life would look like without the internet, when in fact, rural populations and developing countries still live without it. I think the future of the internet and AI does not have to look so bleak if the right measures are put in place. The issue we have in the contemporary media is simply getting our institutional leaders on board, and that might be where my fear lies.</p>

    <h2><i>Chapter 3 from “Hamlet on the Holodeck” by Janet Murray, 1997:</i></h2>
    <p>Murray begins this chapter with tracing evolution of storytelling from the birth of cinema to contemporary digital narratives. She references the “Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station”, illustrating how early filmmakers transformed existing technology into a new artistic medium through innovative narrative techniques. It reminds me of a quote I read recently in “Media Worlds, Anthropology on New Terrain" by Faye D. Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod, and Brian Larkin. The quote is by Raymond Willams and reads as follows, “It is often said that [media have] altered our world. In the same way, people often speak of a new world, a new society, a new phase of history, being created—“brought about”—by this or that new technology: the steam engine, the automobile,
the atomic bomb. Most of us know what is generally implied when such things are said. But this may be the central difficulty: that we have got so used to statements of this general kind, in our most ordinary discussions, that we fail to realise their specific meanings. . . .</p>
<p>Yet all questions about cause and effect, as between technology and a society, are intensely practical. Until we have begun to answer them, we really do not know, in any particular sense, whether, for example, we are talking about a technology or about the uses of a technology; about necessary institutions or particular and changeable institutions; about a content or about a form. And this is not only a matter of intellectual uncertainty; it is a matter of social practice.” Murray and Williams both share a critique of technological determinism. In Williams quote, he argues that technologies do not create social change by themselves, they acquire meaning through human use. It feels easy to assert that “media changed the world”, but that oversimplifies our relationship with technology. Murray has a similar argument that narrative power of technology comes from the ways designers and users collaboratively shape interactive environments. Both authors treat technology as a cultural form rather than an autonomous force.</p>
<p>I also found the part about Eliza fascinating. The analogy Eliza : Weizenbaum :: ChatGPT : Sam Altman; highlights that both creators expressed serious concern about how their technologies and societies would interact. The technology alone could do no harm, but the narratives, institutions, expectations, and anxieties surrounding it could. Technologies and media forms don’t change society by themselves. Society determines how they are received, interpreted, and integrated. With the conclusion of Murray's chapter, I think artists have adapted to the essential properties of the digital environment. Users now have the agency to consume media in ways that have never been done. This notion of choice excites me.</p>

    <h2><i>Chapter 1 & 2 from “The Electronic Disturbance” by CAE, 1994:</i></h2>
    <p>The Critical Art Ensemble used chapter 1 to introduce the concept where society has been preparing for a new electronic space. I appreciated how the text changed so slightly to show that this was always the trajectory. “The revolution in technology brought about by the rapid development of the computer and video has created a new geography of power relations in the first world that could only be imagined as little as twenty years ago”. This direct quote from the first page makes me think of the song, “Video Killed the Radio Star”, as musicians had to transform their art from something people interact with only their ears, but their eyes as well. The more senses we can incorporate the experience becomes that much more valuable and memorable. It essentially is creating a new way of meaning making. This development is partially in our hands, but we now have to contextualize how things actually exist now.</p> 
<p>Chapter 2 then follows the concept of “liquesence”. I never knew there was a word for something the collective is experiencing in this age of modernity–cool! Because of this dissolution, traditional power structures have been threatened. With technologies and the virtual world, we have another layer of visibility and ability to go viral, but do these actions ultimately enact any meaningful change in society? Groups like Anonymous have hacked government systems, but the government continues to increase its surveillance and indirect control over us every day. I interpret that the group’s work focused on political disruption with the internet’s ability and what can be done online with media art. A contemporary example this mirrors was when One Piece’s flag was flown during the 2025 Nepalese youth protests. Since then, it has been used globally as a symbol of political liberation by Gen-Z.</p>

    <h2><i>"An Ironic Dream of a Common Language for Women in the Integrated Circuit," and "The Informatics of Domination" From A Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway 1985:</i></h2>
    <p>I will admit that my previous conception of a cyborg was quite static. I tended to think of figures such as the Terminator from James Cameron’s 1984 film or Edward Scissorhands prior to this reading. Haraway, however, reframes the cyborg as a political myth, a transformative figure within feminist and social discourse. I am struck by the irony her text reveals, particularly when I consider my own initial understanding of the cyborg as a product of patriarchal, western entertainment, in contrast to what Haraway proposes.</p>
<p>I was especially drawn to her articulation of cyborgs as participants in “a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end” (4). At the Master’s level, the goal is not only to comprehend a text but to understand the theoretical frameworks and intellectual assumptions that shaped its production. For me, this quotation exemplifies a central insight of cultural theory: that gender is historically produced rather than biologically determined. If gender is not natural, then imagining a world without gender becomes a legitimate theoretical and political project. This reading came as a good time as I have recently been fascinated by the idea that gender emerges from material arrangements, so I appreciated Haraway’s capacity to identify both the structures of oppression and the possibility that liberation may lie in constructing a “new” consciousness.</p>

    <h2><i>Constituents of a Theory of the Media by Enzensberger, 1970:</i></h2>
    <p>Every generation must deal with new technologies that inevitably change the course of our society. Enzensberger highlights how many properties and tools of new media have expanded abilities to control and influence the population in mass numbers. He reckons with this power and the lack of forces to stop its inevitable advances. His text reads like a survey and warning of the current media landscape.</p> 
<p>“The new media are egalitarian in structure. Anyone can take part in them by a simple switching process. The programmes themselves are not material things and can be reproduced at will. In this sense the electronic media are entirely different from the older media (20). This egalitarian ethos has a strong potential for consumer trust and organizing given the shift in trust from legacy media and the fact that these new media channels feel like grassroots flyers versus corporate mailers. The issue is in this nature being co-opted by hegemonic forces to manufacture compliance and consent. Many analysts believe Trump’s latest presidential win was due, in large part, to him appearing on so many new media platforms. As a guest on various podcasts and new media news channels, he was able to humanize himself to an audience skeptical of state power even though he is ultimately a figurehead of that power.</p>
<p>Ezensenberg describes how the Left in the 70s is impotent and defensive against the Right with a naïve and ineffective “moral indignation”. This doesn’t seem to have changed much, as our current Left complains about the loss of morality and decorum from the Right but does little to stop the rollback of rights and movement of money and tax breaks to the few that already hoard our nation’s wealth. While I find that there has been great power in decentralizing media by platforming non-industry individuals, this new media power, however, is dangerous, as we have been able to manufacture an audience based on the pretense of “clickbait” and distance from the mainstream. Although this leaves space for alternative narratives to legacy media, it leaves an opening for right wing media to gain legitimacy as well. Ezensenberg notices the potential for exploitation stating, “Monopoly capitalism develops the consciousness-shaping industry more quickly and more extensively than other sectors of production; it must at the same time fetter it. A socialist media theory has to work at this contradiction” (14). A new media system is easily exploited by Monopoly capitalism, by paying media figures to parrot narratives like how Sinclair Broadcast Group quietly gives must-read scripts to many local news stations or how both Republican and Democrats pay influencers under the table to run propaganda for their party. He notes that there is “emancipatory potential” in the new media ecosystem but no guiding theories to help get us there. The question becomes, what will it take to get us to mobilize and use these new media tools to provide liberation for ourselves and others? With the blurring of fact and fiction, our job as consumers of media is becoming increasingly complex and difficult. We need more education in a time where public education is being defunded to teach the upcoming generations how to discern good information from propaganda.</p>

    <h2><i>The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1967:</i></h2>
    <p>
Before I picked up on the fact that this text was critiquing modern capitalist society from a marxist, anti consumerist, revolutionary perspective, I assumed it had something to do with Nihilism.   
   </p>
   <p> 
Nihilism is the philosophical view that states that life is meaningless, and that all values and beliefs are meaningless. I assumed this was so after reading this quote, “The spectacle is the nightmare of the imprisoned modern society which ultimately expresses nothing more than its desire to sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of sleep.” When we are asleep we are unable to actively think, move, or see. In this context to be asleep and to only care for sleep could mean to be uneducated or willingly ignorant. Which would check out given that “woke” means to stay vigilant or aware of systemic racial injustices. This plays into the concept of nihilism well since nihilism or nihilistic people move through society as if nothing matters, they are passive people that succumb to meaningless lives for a multitude of reasons (there are different types of nihilism). We have seen nihilism before our very eyes and it is in all of us as these last two years Israhell has bombarded Palestinians with psychological warfare, forced famine, and the destruction of their land while we watch from our phones inside a supermarket. This is nihilism at work as well as the spectacle in the reading. The fact that we can watch from afar at the destruction of these people and remove ourselves from the narrative is nihilistic. The difference between the spectacle as talked about in the reading and nihilism is that we can choose to be nihilistic, we can choose to carry on with our lives as if nothing mattered. We can’t choose to be affected by the spectacle. The spectacle is a social relationship between people that makes us relate to each other through our commodities instead of relating to each other directly. It disconnects us from reality and promotes mass consumerism and once we’ve consumed past our means then we begin to disconnect from the objects themselves and forget the labor that went into making them. Everyone loves their tech so when it came out a year ago that there are children in Congo mining the natural resources that are needed for making an iPhone, no one batted an eye. We are so connected to our phones and having the latest updates that we can freely disconnect from the troubles that it takes to make these devices. 
   </p>
   <p>
     Alienation is probably the biggest obstacle faced when talking about the spectacle because it affects everybody. Not being an active participant in your own life is like walking yourself somewhere but only making it there because your feet know where to go, not because your brain is on. The spectacle makes us bystanders, watching our lives from the sidelines and distancing us from genuine human connection with other bystanders. It prevents us from taking action. The spectacle at work is watching a video on your phone of a black person being killed due to police brutality and then scrolling past a video on Instagram of people protesting for Black Lives Matter. We remove ourselves from the narrative and have the belief that we are distant from the problem and in no way expert enough to come up with a solution so instead we do absolutely nothing. This reminds me of a tweet I saw yesterday that said “the greatest ally fascism and genocide has are the people who say ‘I don’t follow the news, it’s too depressing.’” In this sense the spectacle could be facism and genocide because the spectacle requires that we do nothing and say nothing. That we continue to live life and consume even if we are unhappy and alone. This means that the spectacle can morph itself into anything that repels community, and in order for the spectacle to continue to work we have to remain unaware of each other’s suffering because if revealed we could discover community and band together to create revolution which would dismantle the spectacle and give us our lives back. It is too bad this country runs on opportunistic, anti community, money hungry psychopaths, at some point the people will wake up though. It starts with us.

    <h2><i>As We May Think by Vannevar Bush, 1945:</i></h2>
    <p>
Modern day technology has gotten eerie, greed has gotten sinister. Reading this text was interesting because you could see the genuine excitement for the age of technology and all of its advancements. It’s scary to think of just how far we’ve come, how dependent we are on our tech, and how much of it there actually is. A quote that stood out to me was, “Man has built a civilization so complex that he needs to mechanize his records more fully if he is to push his experiment to its logical conclusion and not merely become bogged down part way there by overtaxing his limited memory. The applications of science have built him a well supplied house and are teaching him to live healthily therein. They have enabled him to throw masses of people against one another with cruel weapons.” Technology today is used for positive purposes like conducting research, communicating globally, and doing laundry but also used for negative purposes like surveillance, receiving misinformation, and cyberbullying. When the Blackberry came out it was all fun and games, the sidekick made texting fun and windows computers had their catchy little tune when they powered on/off. Today everything is monotonous and used against us. Apple has become one of the most powerful monopolies on the market with its ugly upgrades and disappearing accessories (I say as I write from my Apple branded laptop). Billionaires continue to suck up all the money they can and tell the rest of us we need to point fingers at each other, all while they watch us fight through the computer screens that were built off the backs of black and brown people. Tech has been on an upward incline that has lined the pockets of CEOs that have invested in its rise. But will tech be the demise of society? Will AI data centers completely leave residents living nearby without water? Will the $700 million funding in AI military warfare continue to ravish the Palestinians in Gaza and then move to other areas that the ultra rich deem in need of ethnic cleansing? Where do we go from here? Will we make AI friends? Partners? Pets? And let’s not even get into censoring and the immense amount of media propaganda we’ve been force fed. Tiktok is no longer an app of free speech as capitalism continues to destroy community and any sense of togetherness we could create. Everything is owned by 6 huge companies that sell our data back and forth. We’re all pawns in a tech scheme that has gone too far from our reach, and with meta glasses and AI powered scenes of Michael Jackson and Tupac “chilling” in Cuba, I fear it’s too late to turn back the clock on how tech is supposed to be used. 
   </p>
   <p> 
I remember when I first found out about the existence of sex robots, that paired with the movie Her and I was completely freaked out that people relied on human connection from robots. Now that future feels like it’s here. With the introduction of AI so readily available and ready to go at a moment's notice people have turned to chatbots to fill in the gaps of their lives. There has been a new introduction of ads on the  MTA’s pee stained subway walls containing the bullshit surveillance necklaces disguised as companionship, also known as friendship.com. Given the current political climate and the use of AI by ICE to capture and detain people off the streets of many major urban cities, everyday civilians have completely vandalized and obliterated these ads deeming them the end of humanity and urging people not to purchase these monitored orbs. But it's almost as if we have them in our homes already. Amazon Alexas, ring doorbells, cameras, smart tvs, laptops, phones, etc. all of these things are hackable and can be used as spyware to watch us in our own homes, and with so much of our information readily available online there’s not much people don’t already know about us anyways. I don’t want to take away from how technology has helped us advance as a society because there’s so many good examples: airplanes, cancer research, cars, vaccinations of all kinds, being able to check my email at 3 am amongst other things. But does the good outway the bad? It depends on who you ask, tech today has had an effect on everyone. From iPad kids to your dad who’s still saving his walkman just in case they make a comeback, tech has gone through many faces and the generations to come will have to deal with the new faces that have been forced on us. As tech progresses so too does greed and as more people find out the truths of how tech and evil go hand in hand, the more they resist the watchful eye of our modern day “Big Brother”.

    <h2><i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin, 1935:</i></h2>
     <p>
I wanted to focus on two quotes I really enjoyed from the text this week and the thoughts that followed after I read them. The first one being: “The painter maintains in his work a natural distance from reality, the cameraman penetrates deeply into its web”. This is why we can see ourselves in show/movie characters like Bojack Horseman or Walter White. These characters are created with a depth that is based in real life and put on a screen. This allows for reflection, introspection, and critical thought. The ways in which we relate to TV personalities often is dependent upon where we are in our lives and the different things we might be going through at that moment in time. It relates to the point that was made on page 3, “even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.” We watch old Disney movies and listen to 90s playlists because of nostalgia. Nothing can take you back to the way you felt when you watched The Cheetah Girls premiere on TV or when you read R.H Sin’s work when it first came out. We are changed individuals after we consume different media and nothing can replicate the headspace you were in when you allowed yourself to be socialized by a piece of work that so many people are watching/looking at for the first time too (and maybe at the same time as you). TV and film are different from other types of media because you can rewatch them. They give you the comfort you craved when you were a viewer the first time. I always watch 17 Again when I’ve had a bad day because it cheers me up and even though I have seen the movie 101 times I always look forward to rewatching it because of how it makes me feel. The experience of then sharing these moments with others who have experienced this piece of media is one of a kind. We create special bonds with people who enjoy the same things as us and look forward to finding new pieces of media that our companionships would like. We listen to the thoughts of a youtube docu-series we saw or the podcast we stumbled upon this morning and then share the ideas of others as our own with our own interpretation of what we think was meant. I’m moving far from where I first began but I wanted to bring it to this quote I thought was interesting, “I can no longer think what I want to think. My thoughts have been replaced by moving images.” I want to pose the question, have we ever been able to just think? We are influenced to think by everything we’re exposed to. Our thoughts aren’t free and they aren’t our own. We take inspiration from everything we see and all of the things we are inspired by have been inspired by other things before us. So with that being said, is there such a thing as an original thought? Is there a space in our minds where we can think wildly with no outside input that can infiltrate our ideas? 
   </p>
   <p> 
Another idea I found interesting as I read this text was the rise of socialism and how Art for art’s sake was born - a concept that stated that art shouldn’t be political, it should focus on things like color, line, and composition. I think that people fail to realize that everything is political and has some kind of political weight in modern society. We are socialized from the minute we are born, to our last moments alive. Even after our deaths the ways we are talked about in the presence of others socializes everyone that hears about us. The fact that people feel like they can remove themselves from the political narrative and just exist is a privilege that is granted to no one because even silence is political. You can choose to ignore political cartoons, make art that only uses the color purple, or completely walk away from conversations as soon as they take a political shift, but you are not free from political affiliation. The politics we are surrounded by are like a bond that sticks to us no matter where we go and it starts with the color of our skin. Seeing as this is so it is no wonder the person who came up with this concept was a white man. The kind of art that you are able to make is political because we make art that is based on our experiences and using what we have at our disposal. This reminds me of a quote I read online by Palestinian Poet Marwan Makhoul, “In order for me to write poetry that isn’t political, I must listen to the birds and in order to hear the birds the warplanes must be silent”

  <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image by Hito Steyerl, 2011:</i></h2>
    <p>
     A quote from Steyerl’s article I really resonated with was, “But, on the other hand, the rampant privatization of intellectual content, along with online marketing and commodification, also enable piracy and appropriation; it gives rise to the circulation of poor images”. I have always thought that putting media behind a paywall makes people want to break the rules. Which is why I lowkey don’t like museums. I already feel as though they are inaccessible to the general public because people feel like they have to “understand art” in order to be able to enjoy it. When you add the fact that it’s behind a paywall that makes people feel if they can’t understand it and have to pay for it then they don’t need to see it. For a long time I had resentment towards museums like the British Museum because they are professional hoarders with lots of space and money to be able to keep art from the public eye. It’s like if you buy a pair of sneakers and then don’t wear them the bottoms of your shoes will rot without you ever having put them on, which is a waste. There is so much art that has never seen the light of day, seeing the same faces admire it from the inside of a storage container just because these institutions have the money to keep it. I went to see the Sistine Chapel this summer and when we got to see The Last Judgement security was telling people they couldn’t take any photographs. That whole experience was contradictory because having gone through the rest of the museums we could take all the pictures we wanted but when we got to see the piece that everyone was there for we couldn’t summarize the experience with a nice photo of what some would consider the most valuable piece. Even though all of these images have been spread around in the past and there are pillows, earrings, and mugs alongside various other items that have images of these famous walls plastered “poorly”, we couldn’t have our phones filled with images of the spectacle. Which is insane because even with a paywall we were restricted with what we could and couldn’t have to accompany our experience. I got some of the pictures I wanted regardless but it’s like they want people to break the rules by telling us we can’t do something. Especially when we’ve already paid for the chance to see something special, we feel as though we are owed something and therefore need keepsakes even if it’s images we never look at again.
   </p>
   <p> 
   A different thought I had involving piracy is the act of spreading images of art around just for the sake of getting it out to the public eye. It reminds me of when artists used to leak their own music or how sometimes we’ll sneak a quick video of a Broadway performance, much like the tiktok videos that have been surfacing of Leslie Odom Jr. The people that do this are modern day Robin hoods because they know not everyone can afford to pay for a ticket to a show or a special movie screening. I remember buying pirated movies from people selling them on the street and you always knew they were gonna be fake, blurry, and downright bad (possibly even the wrong movie) but if you couldn’t afford to see something in theaters it was a great way to create a good memory out of a terrible viewing experience. The internet has made it possible to go back in the past and watch movies and TV we loved without the terrible quality and if the movie is old enough it might even be free. Which goes to show that this was always possible but capitalism will always prioritize profit over community and at the end of the day that’s what seeing the same media creates. It’s a chance to discuss the aspects of a movie you enjoyed, or what you liked about the colors used in that painting, or your favorite guitar riff in that one song. When you privatize media there are people who cannot join the conversation so I love that Vertov says that the “poor images” that circulate of the media we love ties back to community and finding sameness within these “visual bonds” we create.
