    <h2><i>Introduction & Randomness from “10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10”, by Nick Montfort et al, 2013:</i></h2>
    <p>The introduction lays out how code and coding languages are cultural artifacts created with aesthetics and functionality. These choices can tell us a lot about the societies that create them. With computers we can assign meaning to almost anything. Someone decided that “RND” should mean random and not “RnD”, or even “$$$”. These choices can do things like limit accessibility. It’s much easier to understand random if the code refers to it as “RND” as opposed to “$$$”. </p> 
<p>The book also explains how randomness has always been essential to forms of play and creativity. Although code and computer systems may seem deterministic, they are filled with cultural meaning and aesthetic choices that rely on balancing levels of randomness. The most relatable experience I have was that of watching my dad play online poker on our family computer growing up. In games like these, elements like difficulty can be controlled with randomness algorithms. If a computer controlled opponent is too random, they can be too hard to predict and feel non-human, but give them just the right amount of randomness and you now have an adequately challenging opponent. In AI, features like “temperature” control how random or reproducible the AI’s answer will be. If you want your AI to be more “creative”, you can up the randomness of its answers! Even non-digital artists use randomness to generate creativity, like when a painter throws paint at a canvas instead of meticulously painting each stroke. Randomness is and has always been an important piece of human creativity.</p>

    <h2><i>"Lo and Behold” by Werner Herzong, 2016:</i></h2>
    <p>I found the film genuinely entertaining. Although the film was only produced 10 years ago, it felt somewhat archival, given the technological advancements we have seen post-pandemic. The movie title being <i>Lo and Behold</i> was serendipitous, in that this verbiage has been used in the King James Bible. It solicits a similar feeling for me as I experience when looking at <i>The Creation of Adam</i>. Although the film tries to emphasize the glory of the internet, the community that started it is not the community that currently runs it. I think we are in a critical time where accountability should be demanded from our institutional leaders. It is easy to “be doomy” over the state the internet is currently in, but this is where trial and error must take place. For example, the Catsouras family experienced, arguably, some of the worst trolling the internet has to offer. Unfortunately, it wasn’t until the visibility of the late Kobe Bryant’s accident that legal safeguards were provided. A portion of this film explored what life would look like without the internet, when in fact, rural populations and developing countries still live without it. I think the future of the internet and AI does not have to look so bleak if the right measures are put in place. The issue we have in the contemporary media is simply getting our institutional leaders on board, and that might be where my fear lies.</p>

    <h2><i>Chapter 3 from “Hamlet on the Holodeck” by Janet Murray, 1997:</i></h2>
    <p>Murray begins this chapter with tracing evolution of storytelling from the birth of cinema to contemporary digital narratives. She references the “Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station”, illustrating how early filmmakers transformed existing technology into a new artistic medium through innovative narrative techniques. It reminds me of a quote I read recently in “Media Worlds, Anthropology on New Terrain" by Faye D. Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod, and Brian Larkin. The quote is by Raymond Willams and reads as follows, “It is often said that [media have] altered our world. In the same way, people often speak of a new world, a new society, a new phase of history, being created—“brought about”—by this or that new technology: the steam engine, the automobile,
the atomic bomb. Most of us know what is generally implied when such things are said. But this may be the central difficulty: that we have got so used to statements of this general kind, in our most ordinary discussions, that we fail to realise their specific meanings. . . .</p>
<p>Yet all questions about cause and effect, as between technology and a society, are intensely practical. Until we have begun to answer them, we really do not know, in any particular sense, whether, for example, we are talking about a technology or about the uses of a technology; about necessary institutions or particular and changeable institutions; about a content or about a form. And this is not only a matter of intellectual uncertainty; it is a matter of social practice.” Murray and Williams both share a critique of technological determinism. In Williams quote, he argues that technologies do not create social change by themselves, they acquire meaning through human use. It feels easy to assert that “media changed the world”, but that oversimplifies our relationship with technology. Murray has a similar argument that narrative power of technology comes from the ways designers and users collaboratively shape interactive environments. Both authors treat technology as a cultural form rather than an autonomous force.</p>
<p>I also found the part about Eliza fascinating. The analogy Eliza : Weizenbaum :: ChatGPT : Sam Altman; highlights that both creators expressed serious concern about how their technologies and societies would interact. The technology alone could do no harm, but the narratives, institutions, expectations, and anxieties surrounding it could. Technologies and media forms don’t change society by themselves. Society determines how they are received, interpreted, and integrated. With the conclusion of Murray's chapter, I think artists have adapted to the essential properties of the digital environment. Users now have the agency to consume media in ways that have never been done. This notion of choice excites me.</p>

    <h2><i>Chapter 1 & 2 from “The Electronic Disturbance” by CAE, 1994:</i></h2>
    <p>The Critical Art Ensemble used chapter 1 to introduce the concept where society has been preparing for a new electronic space. I appreciated how the text changed so slightly to show that this was always the trajectory. “The revolution in technology brought about by the rapid development of the computer and video has created a new geography of power relations in the first world that could only be imagined as little as twenty years ago”. This direct quote from the first page makes me think of the song, “Video Killed the Radio Star”, as musicians had to transform their art from something people interact with only their ears, but their eyes as well. The more senses we can incorporate the experience becomes that much more valuable and memorable. It essentially is creating a new way of meaning making. This development is partially in our hands, but we now have to contextualize how things actually exist now.</p> 
<p>Chapter 2 then follows the concept of “liquesence”. I never knew there was a word for something the collective is experiencing in this age of modernity–cool! Because of this dissolution, traditional power structures have been threatened. With technologies and the virtual world, we have another layer of visibility and ability to go viral, but do these actions ultimately enact any meaningful change in society? Groups like Anonymous have hacked government systems, but the government continues to increase its surveillance and indirect control over us every day. I interpret that the group’s work focused on political disruption with the internet’s ability and what can be done online with media art. A contemporary example this mirrors was when One Piece’s flag was flown during the 2025 Nepalese youth protests. Since then, it has been used globally as a symbol of political liberation by Gen-Z.</p>

    <h2><i>"An Ironic Dream of a Common Language for Women in the Integrated Circuit," and "The Informatics of Domination" From A Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway 1985:</i></h2>
    <p>I will admit that my previous conception of a cyborg was quite static. I tended to think of figures such as the Terminator from James Cameron’s 1984 film or Edward Scissorhands prior to this reading. Haraway, however, reframes the cyborg as a political myth, a transformative figure within feminist and social discourse. I am struck by the irony her text reveals, particularly when I consider my own initial understanding of the cyborg as a product of patriarchal, western entertainment, in contrast to what Haraway proposes.</p>
<p>I was especially drawn to her articulation of cyborgs as participants in “a world without gender, which is perhaps a world without genesis, but maybe also a world without end” (4). At the Master’s level, the goal is not only to comprehend a text but to understand the theoretical frameworks and intellectual assumptions that shaped its production. For me, this quotation exemplifies a central insight of cultural theory: that gender is historically produced rather than biologically determined. If gender is not natural, then imagining a world without gender becomes a legitimate theoretical and political project. This reading came as a good time as I have recently been fascinated by the idea that gender emerges from material arrangements, so I appreciated Haraway’s capacity to identify both the structures of oppression and the possibility that liberation may lie in constructing a “new” consciousness.</p>

    <h2><i>Constituents of a Theory of the Media by Enzensberger, 1970:</i></h2>
    <p>Every generation must deal with new technologies that inevitably change the course of our society. Enzensberger highlights how many properties and tools of new media have expanded abilities to control and influence the population in mass numbers. He reckons with this power and the lack of forces to stop its inevitable advances. His text reads like a survey and warning of the current media landscape.</p> 
<p>“The new media are egalitarian in structure. Anyone can take part in them by a simple switching process. The programmes themselves are not material things and can be reproduced at will. In this sense the electronic media are entirely different from the older media (20). This egalitarian ethos has a strong potential for consumer trust and organizing given the shift in trust from legacy media and the fact that these new media channels feel like grassroots flyers versus corporate mailers. The issue is in this nature being co-opted by hegemonic forces to manufacture compliance and consent. Many analysts believe Trump’s latest presidential win was due, in large part, to him appearing on so many new media platforms. As a guest on various podcasts and new media news channels, he was able to humanize himself to an audience skeptical of state power even though he is ultimately a figurehead of that power.</p>
<p>Ezensenberg describes how the Left in the 70s is impotent and defensive against the Right with a naïve and ineffective “moral indignation”. This doesn’t seem to have changed much, as our current Left complains about the loss of morality and decorum from the Right but does little to stop the rollback of rights and movement of money and tax breaks to the few that already hoard our nation’s wealth. While I find that there has been great power in decentralizing media by platforming non-industry individuals, this new media power, however, is dangerous, as we have been able to manufacture an audience based on the pretense of “clickbait” and distance from the mainstream. Although this leaves space for alternative narratives to legacy media, it leaves an opening for right wing media to gain legitimacy as well. Ezensenberg notices the potential for exploitation stating, “Monopoly capitalism develops the consciousness-shaping industry more quickly and more extensively than other sectors of production; it must at the same time fetter it. A socialist media theory has to work at this contradiction” (14). A new media system is easily exploited by Monopoly capitalism, by paying media figures to parrot narratives like how Sinclair Broadcast Group quietly gives must-read scripts to many local news stations or how both Republican and Democrats pay influencers under the table to run propaganda for their party. He notes that there is “emancipatory potential” in the new media ecosystem but no guiding theories to help get us there. The question becomes, what will it take to get us to mobilize and use these new media tools to provide liberation for ourselves and others? With the blurring of fact and fiction, our job as consumers of media is becoming increasingly complex and difficult. We need more education in a time where public education is being defunded to teach the upcoming generations how to discern good information from propaganda.</p>

    <h2><i>The Society of the Spectacle by Guy Debord, 1967:</i></h2>
    <p>I found the reading to be dense at points, but was taken aback with its timeless accuracy. The Spectacle, as Guy Debord describes it, is today’s modern consumption economy, but more accurately it is a more complex compilation of symbols and ideas. Though it cannot be everything, it is autonomous in its nature and exists in the present, influencing and aligning society’s perception of the truth. It is the driving force in the production of present day society and social relations. The spectacle’s means, and goal itself, is the act of separation. Debord notes this separation from ourselves, each other, and our labor.</p>
    <i>Points I found fascinating:</i>

<p>The spectacle has transformed social life from “being into having” (17), then having into appearing. The falsified reality of influencer culture in producing a “perfect body” with actually <i>having one</i> is a direct experience permeating through society today. As a result of capitalism, the goal and function of the spectacle is to abstract and degrade. You do not need to “have” anymore, appearances themselves have now taken on intrinsic social value.</p> 
<p>“The point where the spectacle inverts the real, in fact is produced” (8) reminds me of a modern day issue AI has confronted us with. Ideas of legitimacy and truth are now in question, by fault of the cloud computing era. The statement, “Within a world really on its head, the true is a moment of the false” (9) exemplifies how the spectacle is not limited by an adherence to objective reality; this is displayed in real time with Trump's “retruths”. With new technologies we can make illusions real, leaving the door open for a reordering of what is true and what is false.</p>
<p>The community spaces, such as markets, have since been replaced, in the wake of mechanical reproduction, with an “abundance of dispossession” (31). Manufacturers such as Shein have eliminated high quality clothing with the abundance of season-to-season availability. Value has been shifted from the quality of substance to the abundance of substance. Furthermore, the promise of capitalism was to facilitate ways to increase production and eliminate our needs, but we now live in a world where companies like Shein manufacture scarcity.</p> 
<p>As we have stepped away from previous generations' threats, we continue to manufacture new needs to ensure survival. “The abundance of commodities, that is, the commodity relation, can be no more than augmented survival” (40). Whereas, in the past, commodities represented resource availability and therefore how capable a society was to survive, this quote displays excess commodification as an inherent function of capitalism, driving consumers to create new threats to modern survival and new commodities to help remedy that.</p>

    <h2><i>As We May Think by Vannevar Bush, 1945:</i></h2>
    <p>Dr.Vannevar Bush, the author of this week's reading, was the head physicist that led over 6,000 scientists in the service of WWll. He addresses a “new relationship between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge”. With a scientific background myself, it is to no one's surprise that Bush was able to identify the boundlessness of man's evolving relationship with technology. The core theme revolves around the ever evolving relationship between scientific inquiry and technological advancements in knowledge management.</p> 
<p>Bush was an advocate in memory processing and predicted many of the issues and themes we see with our current technological era. With technologies like microphotography, Bush saw that “The basic scheme of reducing the size of the record, and examining it by projection” could lead to a time where we could synthesize and hold enormous amounts of data that could quickly and readily be accessed (113). With the ability to hold and rapidly access the accumulated knowledge of humanity, Bush also understood its limitations and potential problems. He notes that “creative thought and essentially repetitive thought are very different things. For the latter there are, and may be, powerful mechanical aids” (116). We can see this issue in the ways AI systems are exceptional at performing repetitive tasks like building a website or compiling 50 different vodka pasta recipes, but are nowhere near being able to perform truly original and creative tasks with any fluency like a human. When discussing huge knowledge bases, he says, “yet even in its present bulk we can hardly consult it . . . The prime action of use is selection, and here we are halting indeed” (118). I often consider how much chat bots provide incorrect information and how we are currently struggling to figure out how best to interact with AI. With an overabundance of information, the game is now figuring out how to purposefully and effectively access this information. What use is all this information if these systems keep giving us AI slop?</p>
<p>Hidden in the introductory section of the article, there is a small passage of this article that brings up an interesting point. He talks about how specialization in the sciences is necessary, and has given us so many more new articles and innovations. On the other hand, it makes bridging disciplines a very difficult task. For example, if I work in material sciences and come up with a new material whose production rapidly increases global warming, I’m not likely to speak with climate scientists to understand that impact. Actors that previously worked in science more generally now specialize and put up blinders for the sake of increasing progress in their specialized field. While this is more efficient and effective, it opens the door to unforeseen consequences.</p>

    <h2><i>The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction by Walter Benjamin, 1935:</i></h2>
    <p>The overall theme I gathered was the reproduction of art using mechanical means and the social implications of said reproduction. The text discusses the historical component where art forms were closely tied to ritualistic practices serving the broader societal functions. With art becoming more widely reproduced, the author suggests that the works' innate aura diminishes. This term is used to describe the unique presence and authenticity of an original work. In contemporary speech, “aura farming”has been used to describe a person intentionally doing something and/or performing to appear “cool”. Aura is subjective as what we give our attention to can be different from the next person. </p>
    <p>An important quote that is central to Benjamin’s essay is, “That which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art” (4). He refers to the art works aura as its unique presence in society. Mechanical reproduction such as photography or film, strips art of that singular presence since copies can be made infinitely. This has fundamentally altered our relationship with art. 
    <p>Mechanical reproduction has allowed mass distribution, thus changing who and when art can be accessed. With this new level of circulation, questions about the authenticity and originality, which were previously linked to value, have emerged. Recently, I began watching youtuber Mina Le, who specializes in video essays. She uploaded a video titled, “Does originality still exist anymore?”:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9VFaJP8UUI&t=664s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9VFaJP8UUI&t=664s</a> where she unpacks modern advertisements recycling ideas from the past. Advertisements today have eliminated the genius of originality, replacing it for society's ability to recall and relate. The ability to reproduce and disseminate original works so easily and quickly has made the landscape of ideas and images to draw from massive. With this abundance of choice and access to these images, we have lost value in the original. Everything becomes up for grabs and allows for forces to commoditize and advertise images and styles unlike previous eras.</p>
    <p>*Edited 9.30* In class notes: Exhibition value vs cult value was really interesting! Cult value is about worship and presence; Exhibition value is about visibility and display.</p>

  <h2><i>In Defense of the Poor Image by Hito Steyerl, 2011:</i></h2>
    <p>The article explores what constitutes a poor image and what that means in the digital age. Visual culture, as it notes, has long been produced within “systems of national culture, capitalist studio production, the cult of mostly male genius, and the original version” (3). The poor image, however, has evolved significantly, both as an artistic form and through the ways it circulates. In many ways, the poor image has gained its own kind of value. Reading this piece reminded me of the summers I spent visiting family in Mexico City and the excitement of stopping by the local panadería. Not only was I allowed to get whatever sweet treat I wanted, but I was able to browse the table full of bootlog movies set up just outside. With my personal interest in archival work, I have come to appreciate these imperfect images from the past because they hold an intrinsic value that transcends technical quality. This leads me to wonder: is the poor image justified within the context of archival work? If not, why do we continue to uphold the pristine image, and what will that mean for the bodies of work produced twenty years from now? As technology and society continue to evolve, the poor image will likely encompass more forms of art, ultimately symbolizing both the democratization of media and the degradation of traditional visual standards.</p>
