   <h1>The Electronic Disturbance</h1>
   <h2>Nov. 5th 2025</h2>
   <p>
Working at a charter school as an empathetic person is not like anything else you’ve ever had to experience. They are famous for being data driven, solution oriented, and different from the public school system. Underneath all of that they are cesspools mimicking complicated data centers, pockets full of dollar signs, and not a single care in the world for education and learning. Every student is a number and that number has to yield high results in order to be valuable within the system. Knowing this as an educator within the charter school system made me think of this quote, “People are reduced to data, surveillance occurs on a global scale, minds are melded to screenal reality, and an authoritarian power emerges that thrives on absence.” We are all data points within the system and that is shown to us through the various statistical numbers used to achieve population data. The percentage of Black people who voted, the percentage of Black people who voted for Trump, the percentage of Black men who voted for Trump vs the percentage of Black women that voted for Trump, the percentage of Black men who voted for Trump ages 18-25 vs the percentage of Black men who voted for Trump ages 55-65. All of these numbers get mixed and mingled until you’re standing in a square with everyone else who looks like you according to the organizing system. All of this data tells us exactly where we fall within this tactical structure, what we don’t know is how whoever acquires this data, uses it. And that’s not even the scariest part anymore. We are so used to organizations selling our data that we don’t even demand that these companies be reprimanded, we just want the 5 dollars we’ll get from the settlement case. After ancestry.com sold their customers' actual DNA data nobody cares about their data being sold online anymore, and even if we did care there would be no way to stop companies from selling our private information. We are so accustomed to not having the privacy of owning our data that we no longer care as long as we get to keep using the apps we love. We are tracked on every site we browse, every country we travel to, and every gas station we fill our tank at. The tracking is endless and the real question that comes to mind is, where is all of this information stored? We don’t think about all the camera footage of the stores we shop at, or the swiping of our cards when we purchase something, or even the meaningless strolls we take when we’re having a bad day, all of that footage is somewhere capturing pieces of our lives that someone else can put together. That’s what authoritarian powers want, access to us even though we haven’t said yes.

“There are many reprobate (rogue) mingled with the good, and both are gathered together in the data base as in a dragnet; and in this world, as in the sea, both swim enclosed without distinction in the electronic net”

This quote made me think about cancer research technology and AI war technology. Both of these kinds of research can be used for good or bad and affect the world in different ways. If we stop the development of tech altogether then everything has to stop, even the cancer research and that would mean that millions of people continue to die everyday to this vicious disease, so we can’t stop. As long as good exists, so too does evil. But at some point will the bad outweigh the good? Will we be forced to stop if the bad becomes too much to bear? If communities are left without clean water to drink because of all the water being used to cool off computers? If permafrost continues to melt and add to our already rising sea levels? If AI gets to the point where we can’t differentiate if we’re talking to a real person or a coded program? When do we stop capitalizing and focus on stimulating growth with what we already have?
