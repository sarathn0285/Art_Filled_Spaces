One of the most important things I took away from the film was if everything were to go digital we would be fucked because we would be left with nothing if the internet were to suddenly shut down or malfunction. This made me think of the current shift we are now facing where the manufacture of pennies is to stop very soon. Could this be a chain reaction to getting rid of physical currency? Are we on our way to becoming a nation that only uses digital currency? What happens with those who don’t have access to technology or the laptop in our pocket that we call a phone? How would you buy your groceries if someone stole your phone which would serve as your wallet, license, and your photo album among other things. In a purely digital world you would need some kind of technological device as well as electricity to be able to access your money. If cash becomes useless what will happen to the houseless people who ask for a dollar? Will they be granted credit card machines so we can tap our phones when we feel like giving them 50 cents? What happens to our money if there was ever a power outage? Would there be a loop hole where our money could be swiped out from under us? Would we be considered cashless until the power comes back on? And if money is power but our money is digital then does that mean no one would have power?

I asked this question in last week’s post: Who are we outside of the digital things we have access to? I love flipping through a book and making notes in it, at some point will physical books be phased out just like newspapers? Will stores close down in mass due to people preferring online shopping? Will supermarkets start to just ship the items people order online? And if that’s the case anything can be hacked, anything could be moved or removed so what is stopping anyone from hacking your shipped order or your surveillance camera? How do you know your favorite book won’t be pulled from shelves, made digital, and rewritten to fit a certain agenda? Or that your favorite piece of music won’t disappear from your spotify playlist? What do we have access to if there isn’t a wifi connection?
