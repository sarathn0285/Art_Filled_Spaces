   <h1>Constituents of a Theory of the Media</h1>
   <h2>Oct. 26th 2025</h2>

It’s insane how far we’ve moved through TV time and tech with sitcoms, reality tv shows, and Tia and Tamera in Twitches. Television and film have always been pretty fictional, not counting hidden camera series like John Quiñones “What would you do?” and Chris Hansen’s “ To Catch A Predator” which I refuse to believe were scripted. TV has always played an interesting role in our lives. It used to be a literal box that had our favorite channels, our most hated characters, and had seen us shed countless amounts of tears during reruns of Derek Shepard’s death in Grey’s Anatomy. Now that box has turned into multiple dimensions of screen with far more viewership. A quote I thought was super interesting in this reading was, “There is no such thing as unmanipulated writing, filming, or broadcasting. The question is therefore not whether the media are manipulated, but who manipulates them. A revolutionary plan should not require the manipulators to disappear; on the contrary, it must make everyone a manipulator.” When I read this quote I immediately thought about Love Island and how Cierra got booted off the show for a couple of racial slurs she had said some years back. We as the audience manipulated the network by threatening low viewership and called for her removal from the show. That altered her reality and manipulated how the rest of the show and “connections” between the remaining cast members were made. Had Cierra been allowed to stay maybe her connection with Nick would’ve lasted and viewership would’ve taken a drastic hit. In all reality this show and many other reality tv shows are manipulated before the shows even begin filming because people manipulate their acts when they know they are on camera and especially knowing everyone else will definitely see their actions at some point. In the episode where the cast learns how America feels about their actions in the show, some of them shift themselves to align with what we want to see on our screens and we watch them manipulate their own actions in later episodes to fit our visual molds. This quote caught my attention because it relates back to the point I always make that everything is political. The kind of tv we watch is no exception. When we begin to question who is manipulating the entertainment we watch, we can begin to see the trends in how we’ve been socialized to think. It makes me think of porn and how the kind of porn we enjoy gives other people insight into who we are. If a white man watches porn where the main star is a black woman every time it could mean he most likely has a fetish and feels as though he cannot act on being with a black woman, most likely doesn’t surround himself with black women or hates black women but loves how we look so can’t bring himself to be with a black woman. The same thing goes for people who watch LGBTQ+ porn but consider themselves straight in “real life”. The porn we watch is indicative of how we would like to manipulate our own lives and the manipulators who make porn cater to the fetishes people want to be able to “experience”.

It’s dystopian to think that a handful of people can control the ways in which we see the world and the different truths that exist out there being limited to a few preselected half truths that we are granted the permission to see. “The problem of censorship thus enters a new historical stage. The struggle for the freedom of the press and freedom of ideas has, up till now, been mainly an argument within the bourgeoisie itself; for the masses, freedom to express opinions was a fiction since they were, from the beginning, barred from the means of production - above all from the press - and thus were unable to join in freedom of expression from the start” This quote made me think of all the ways censorship applies to us without us knowing it does. The different ways we are censored without the knowledge that we never had a choice in the first place. I thought it was funny when that white guy said that TV would be the ruin of the white man in South Africa because white people have always been the cause of their own ruin. Imagine being so ill-intentioned that you would deny a population (if you could) of being aware of the atrocities you’re committing. War and crime at the hands of the government have always tried to be hidden from the public and the reality is we see about two percent of the Freudian slips they make or the slip ups they let air on tv. These people are so soulless and so riddled with corruption that it wouldn’t matter if we could turn on the tv and watch war at the click of a button. We can literally do that now with the genocide that’s happening in Palestine and nothing is being done. We don’t even need the censorship to know the truth about what’s happening over there. They (Israel and the US) censor our shit because now that people know what’s going on they are public enemy number one and that’s what everyone is actually afraid of. The sway of public opinion has shifted so vastly, they don’t care that people are still dying, they care that people care about the people dying. This talk about war makes me think about the war on the “Middle East” (which should be referred to as West Asia) and how after 9/11 Americans were so distraught with what had happened they wanted anyone to pay and who knows maybe if the atrocities Bush committed in West Asia had been broadcasted as the genocide in Palestine has been televised more people would’ve empathetically stood up and said “no more”. Given that the United States government made the whole world feel like they were a part of the terrorist attacks, they felt they had the world's “ok” to go and destabilize, pulverize, and destroy which is what they’ve done since the beginning of the new world. It begs the questions, who puts people in charge of censoring the truth from the rest of the world? Who is responsible for the censorship that we, an ordinary public, experience and how many ugly truths are out there that we haven’t seen?
