   <h1>Introduction & Randomness</h1>
   <h2>Nov. 23rd 2025</h2>
   <p>
Would you ever think of yourself as a computer? No right? Because humans are able to express their feelings and move uncontested. Well what if we said language was code? Would you see yourself as a machine then? When I was younger I used to question the different ways language worked and why it had the meaning it does and that made me think of this quote, “Code is a peculiar kind of text, written, maintained, and modified by programmers to make a machine operate. It is a text nonetheless, with many of the properties of more familiar documents”. Who decided when they looked at the color red that it would be named red or that something for sitting would be called a chair? What if the words for refrigerator and desktop were switched? How is meaning attached to words? When we use slang is it based on the original meaning of a word or something random? If we know multiple languages and are able to communicate in different parts of the globe are we programmable machines? The people responsible for all of the languages spoken around the planet are then also categorized as programmers, and that means we are the programmed. We pass language down and that makes our role of programmed programmers interchangeable.

Another quote I found interesting was, “Randomness and chance operations are so necessary to daily life, well beyond the realm of games, that randomness itself is framed as fixed, repeatable, and knowable.” I think this is the case because we don’t know where we come from. At least in my community there has always been talk about how everything is in god’s hands and how they will provide in times of need. That uncertainty is what drives religion and what keeps people wedged between a rock and a hand place. Ultimately I do think that uncertainty has more reach than just religion but it is a good driver to keeping people submissive and “waiting” for the uncertain times to pass. Sometimes we would prefer to remain uncertain because we know making a decision will lead us to the obvious which is not always what we want. A lot of people take advantage of randomness and chance to further themselves in a game no one wants to play because making decisions is hard and affects everyone, not just the person making the decision. Sometimes we create uncertain situations on purpose to give us more time to wade through what we feel like is endless time, but with uncertainty also comes confusion, violence, and sensitivity and what could’ve been a short period of leaving life up to chance is now a series of distressing decisions.
