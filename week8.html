   <h1>Hamlet on the Holodeck</h1>

I have always wondered how we can see websites that were created elsewhere like Manila or London? How does the information someone put on a website appear on our screen as if we were in that person’s living room? And in turn how does the government ban us from looking at certain kinds of media online? How are they able to censor what we can and can’t see? These questions make me think about the current push that people have made to own the media they consume and that made me think about this quote, “since every form of representation is migrating to electronic form and all the world’s computers are potentially accessible to one another, we can now conceive of a single comprehensive global library of paintings, films, books, newspapers, television programs, and databases, a library that would be accessible from any point on the globe.” Now don’t get me wrong, this list is comprehensive and super impressive but is anyone thinking about what happens if everything we know goes digital? How will anyone who doesn’t have access to an electronic device be able to ride the bus if the MTA is no longer accepting coins? What if bridge signals become digital, if they malfunction will boats crash? Will people die? What if your self-driving car makes a mistake and runs a red? Is the “driver” responsible for that? I love that we can see pieces from the Tate Modern, read banned books, and listen to music from different countries, but have we gone too far? Do we actually own anything if everything is reliant on an internet connection? When the connection is shaky our media runs slow and when the connection is down, we don’t have anything. Who are we outside of the digital things we have access to?
