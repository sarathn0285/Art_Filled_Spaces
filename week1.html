   <h1>In Defense of the Poor Image</h1>
   <h2>Sept. 14th 2025</h2>
   <p>
     A quote from Steyerl’s article I really resonated with was, “But, on the other hand, the rampant privatization of intellectual content, along with online marketing and commodification, also enable piracy and appropriation; it gives rise to the circulation of poor images”. I have always thought that putting media behind a paywall makes people want to break the rules. Which is why I lowkey don’t like museums. I already feel as though they are inaccessible to the general public because people feel like they have to “understand art” in order to be able to enjoy it. When you add the fact that it’s behind a paywall that makes people feel if they can’t understand it and have to pay for it then they don’t need to see it. For a long time I had resentment towards museums like the British Museum because they are professional hoarders with lots of space and money to be able to keep art from the public eye. It’s like if you buy a pair of sneakers and then don’t wear them the bottoms of your shoes will rot without you ever having put them on, which is a waste. There is so much art that has never seen the light of day, seeing the same faces admire it from the inside of a storage container just because these institutions have the money to keep it. I went to see the Sistine Chapel this summer and when we got to see The Last Judgement security was telling people they couldn’t take any photographs. That whole experience was contradictory because having gone through the rest of the museums we could take all the pictures we wanted but when we got to see the piece that everyone was there for we couldn’t summarize the experience with a nice photo of what some would consider the most valuable piece. Even though all of these images have been spread around in the past and there are pillows, earrings, and mugs alongside various other items that have images of these famous walls plastered “poorly”, we couldn’t have our phones filled with images of the spectacle. Which is insane because even with a paywall we were restricted with what we could and couldn’t have to accompany our experience. I got some of the pictures I wanted regardless but it’s like they want people to break the rules by telling us we can’t do something. Especially when we’ve already paid for the chance to see something special, we feel as though we are owed something and therefore need keepsakes even if it’s images we never look at again.

   A different thought I had involving piracy is the act of spreading images of art around just for the sake of getting it out to the public eye. It reminds me of when artists used to leak their own music or how sometimes we’ll sneak a quick video of a Broadway performance, much like the tiktok videos that have been surfacing of Leslie Odom Jr. The people that do this are modern day Robin hoods because they know not everyone can afford to pay for a ticket to a show or a special movie screening. I remember buying pirated movies from people selling them on the street and you always knew they were gonna be fake, blurry, and downright bad (possibly even the wrong movie) but if you couldn’t afford to see something in theaters it was a great way to create a good memory out of a terrible viewing experience. The internet has made it possible to go back in the past and watch movies and TV we loved without the terrible quality and if the movie is old enough it might even be free. Which goes to show that this was always possible but capitalism will always prioritize profit over community and at the end of the day that’s what seeing the same media creates. It’s a chance to discuss the aspects of a movie you enjoyed, or what you liked about the colors used in that painting, or your favorite guitar riff in that one song. When you privatize media there are people who cannot join the conversation so I love that Vertov says that the “poor images” that circulate of the media we love ties back to community and finding sameness within these “visual bonds” we create.
