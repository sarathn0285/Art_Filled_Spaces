   <h1>A Cyborg Manifesto</h1>
   <h2>Oct. 31st 2025</h2>
   <p>
Authors like Toni Morrison, Bell Hooks, Yaa Gyasi, Zora Neale Hurston etc, have revolutionized writing in such an educated way. In a way that white people never meant for black women to be educated. That’s why this quote resonated with me so intensely, “Cyborg writing is about the power to survive, not on the basis of original innocence, but on the basis of seizing the tools to mark that world that marked them as other” …. “Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control.” I remember watching an interviewer ask Toni Morrison if she ever thought that her writing might include the lives of white people. To which Morrison responded that white people are everywhere and are always being written about and that one day she would understand that her question had racist undertones because white people's history is everywhere, even in places it doesn’t have to be. I think about that interview often and it makes me think of all the times my white English teachers would make space for the women of color they proudly taught and chose works by these eloquently spoken Black women. I think about what a privilege it is to have been so well read at such a young age. To be able to articulate myself well even in the whitest of rooms where no one is expecting it and it’s all thanks to cyborg writing. It’s all thanks to those that were given hell when their books came out about how racism is embedded in every framework we’ve ever known. All the story lines and plots I’ve read of black women fighting to be seen, to be themselves even in the last couple of pages as their lungs give out with hope that the ones that come after them will have it better, that we won’t have to fight as hard. How saddening to think that kids today maybe won’t get to read these kinds of texts in high school because knowledge is power and a well read society is a powerful one, the opposite of what an authoritarian state wants. The war on literacy is intentional and it is an attack on democracy because an illiterate society is impressionable, easily gaslit, and powerless. Cyborg writing has been the start of so many revolts, rallies, and cries for equality, but it has also been a tool used to bridge community, to be able to advocate for yourself, and you love yourself unconditionally. Cyborg writing has paved the way for us to be able to express ourselves because no fight has ever been won without the words of a black woman and every fight for liberation has always had the help of black women.
