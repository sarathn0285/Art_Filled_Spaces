   <h1>The Society of the Spectacle</h1>
   <h2>Oct. 12th 2025</h2>
   <p>
Before I picked up on the fact that this text was critiquing modern capitalist society from a marxist, anti consumerist, revolutionary perspective, I assumed it had something to do with Nihilism.

   <p> 
Nihilism is the philosophical view that states that life is meaningless, and that all values and beliefs are meaningless. I assumed this was so after reading this quote, “The spectacle is the nightmare of the imprisoned modern society which ultimately expresses nothing more than its desire to sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of sleep.” When we are asleep we are unable to actively think, move, or see. In this context to be asleep and to only care for sleep could mean to be uneducated or willingly ignorant. Which would check out given that “woke” means to stay vigilant or aware of systemic racial injustices. This plays into the concept of nihilism well since nihilism or nihilistic people move through society as if nothing matters, they are passive people that succumb to meaningless lives for a multitude of reasons (there are different types of nihilism). We have seen nihilism before our very eyes and it is in all of us as these last two years Israhell has bombarded Palestinians with psychological warfare, forced famine, and the destruction of their land while we watch from our phones inside a supermarket. This is nihilism at work as well as the spectacle in the reading. The fact that we can watch from afar at the destruction of these people and remove ourselves from the narrative is nihilistic. The difference between the spectacle as talked about in the reading and nihilism is that we can choose to be nihilistic, we can choose to carry on with our lives as if nothing mattered. We can’t choose to be affected by the spectacle. The spectacle is a social relationship between people that makes us relate to each other through our commodities instead of relating to each other directly. It disconnects us from reality and promotes mass consumerism and once we’ve consumed past our means then we begin to disconnect from the objects themselves and forget the labor that went into making them. Everyone loves their tech so when it came out a year ago that there are children in Congo mining the natural resources that are needed for making an iPhone, no one batted an eye. We are so connected to our phones and having the latest updates that we can freely disconnect from the troubles that it takes to make these devices.

     Alienation is probably the biggest obstacle faced when talking about the spectacle because it affects everybody. Not being an active participant in your own life is like walking yourself somewhere but only making it there because your feet know where to go, not because your brain is on. The spectacle makes us bystanders, watching our lives from the sidelines and distancing us from genuine human connection with other bystanders. It prevents us from taking action. The spectacle at work is watching a video on your phone of a black person being killed due to police brutality and then scrolling past a video on Instagram of people protesting for Black Lives Matter. We remove ourselves from the narrative and have the belief that we are distant from the problem and in no way expert enough to come up with a solution so instead we do absolutely nothing. This reminds me of a tweet I saw yesterday that said “the greatest ally fascism and genocide has are the people who say ‘I don’t follow the news, it’s too depressing.’” In this sense the spectacle could be facism and genocide because the spectacle requires that we do nothing and say nothing. That we continue to live life and consume even if we are unhappy and alone. This means that the spectacle can morph itself into anything that repels community, and in order for the spectacle to continue to work we have to remain unaware of each other’s suffering because if revealed we could discover community and band together to create revolution which would dismantle the spectacle and give us our lives back. It is too bad this country runs on opportunistic, anti community, money hungry psychopaths, at some point the people will wake up though. It starts with us.
